Four needed files for rails application:


1. Dockerfile - Define exactly what needs to be included in Docker container.
2. Gemfile - just loads Rails
3. Gemfile.lock - to build our Dockerfile
4. docker-compose.yml - is where the magic happens.  This file describes the
   services that comprise your app (a database and a web app), how to get
   each one's Docker image (the database just runs on a pre-made PostgreSQL
   image, and the web app is built from the current directory), and the
   configuration needed to link them together and expose the web app's port.
