Filelist
========
4-needed-files.txt
  Four needed files for rails application:

  1. Dockerfile - Define exactly what needs to be included in Docker container.
  2. Gemfile - just loads Rails
  3. Gemfile.lock - to build our Dockerfile
  4. docker-compose.yml - is where the magic happens.  This file describes the
     services that comprise your app (a database and a web app), how to get
     each one's Docker image (the database just runs on a pre-made PostgreSQL
     image, and the web app is built from the current directory), and the
     configuration needed to link them together and expose the web app's port.
