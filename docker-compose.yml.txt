"Finally, docker-compose.yml is where the magic happens.
This file describes the services that comprise your app
(a database and a web app), how to get each one’s Docker
image (the database just runs on a pre-made PostgreSQL
image, and the web app is built from the current
directory), and the configuration needed to link them
together and expose the web app’s port."
